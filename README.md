## Summary
Booking transportation to and from Urbana-Champaign is cumbersome and confusing; students may feel overwhelmed by their many options (including Peoria Charter, the Amtrak, Greyhound) and scrolling through each website for time availability and cost appropriate choices can be a tedious task. OnBoard mitigates these challenges by providing a centralized space to book tickets, and creating opportunities for local transportation businesses to further their reach within their communities. 

## Technical Architecture

![Technical Architecture](relative/path/to/app_architecture.png?raw=true "Technical Architecture")

Frontend: Utilized Javascript and Bootstrap CSS library to design and implement interactive pages for our web application.

Backend: Utilized Python Flask framework and SQL Alchemy to connect front-end features such as the user interface, account sessions, and ticket selection platform to a backend SQL-Lite database that holds transportation service options and availability. 

## Installation 
To run the application, run the following commands

```python
cd Flask\ Backend/
flask run
```
and then visit http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to view application
